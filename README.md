=========
This thesis will model a dynamic Demand Responsive Transit system in Tacoma, and compare it to Pierce Transit's existing 
fixed bus route to determine if it can offer riders quicker trip times at a comparable operational cost to the transit 
agency. Demand Responsive Transit (DRT) vehicles do not operate on defined routes, instead riders call in pickup and 
drop-off locations as they would a taxi. Vehicles are then routed throughout the service area to serve the riders while 
minimizing transit time and operational cost. DRT systems are often used to service disabled riders who cannot use 
conventional transit, or riders in low-density areas with limited transit demand. To the best of the author's knowledge, 
this project would be the first to look at a DRT system serving all transit riders in an urban environment.
